This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes â€”Â this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

# Analytics Service

A generic, flexible analytics service for React Native that supports multiple Google Analytics 4 (GA4) properties.

## Features

- âœ… **Multi-Project Support**: Track events to different GA4 properties
- âœ… **Generic Interface**: Easy to use with any project structure
- âœ… **React Hook**: Simple integration with React components
- âœ… **TypeScript Support**: Fully typed interfaces
- âœ… **Persistent Client IDs**: Each project maintains its own client ID
- âœ… **No External Dependencies**: Uses built-in fetch API

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure Projects

Edit `src/config/AnalyticsConfig.ts`:

```typescript
export const ANALYTICS_PROJECTS: Record<string, ProjectAnalyticsConfig> = {
  main: {
    measurementId: 'G-ECMNWKHPGR',
    apiSecret: 'lEXviq-yRuCEWIAwErz6QA',
    projectName: 'Main Project',
  },
  us: {
    measurementId: 'G-XXXXXXXXXX',
    apiSecret: 'YOUR_US_API_SECRET',
    projectName: 'US Project',
  },
  // Add more projects...
};
```

### 2. Use in React Components

```typescript
import { useAnalytics } from './src/hooks/useAnalytics';

function MyComponent() {
  const { logEvent, setCurrentProject } = useAnalytics();

  const handleButtonClick = async () => {
    await logEvent('button_click', {
      button_name: 'submit',
      screen: 'login',
    });
  };

  return <Button title="Submit" onPress={handleButtonClick} />;
}
```

### 3. Switch Projects

```typescript
// Switch to different project
setCurrentProject('us');

// Log event to specific project
await logEvent('test_event', {}, 'uk');

// Log to multiple projects
await logEventToMultipleProjects('global_event', {}, ['main', 'us', 'uk']);
```

## File Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AnalyticsService.ts          # Generic analytics service
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useAnalytics.ts              # React hook

```
